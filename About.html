                <p>
                My love for making videos started at a young age. 
                When I was in 6th grade, 
                I started videorecording myself on the trampoline and biking.  
                And it all has evolved from there.  I also started to play 
                video games at a young age and are still partially involved 
                in that. I always wondered how it was made and has a facination 
                for technology. </p>

                <p>
                When I started junior high school, 
                I choose “Media and communication“ as my electives. 
                From the first day I knew I would try to enter into the 
                business of Media and communications at High School as well.

                <p>
                In Highschool,  
                I did a lot of interesting and fun projects. 
                My and a friend make a lot of car videos for the car 
                community in Trondheim. 
                And I also became a finalist and won one of the main 
                prizes in a European film festival held in Portugal.

                <h2>University in Lillehammer</h2>
                <p>
                After Highschool, 
                I attended a one-year study in Lillehammer, Norway. 
                The focus was on “Audivisuelle medier“. 
                Where we learned a lot about film theory, 
                and the Norwegian film, TV, and game industry.

                 <p>
                    And when I found the 3D and Animations study in 
                    Bergen I knew that was the one for me. 
                    From making a Lego figure to learning the basics of modeling.    
                    To realistic renders, character rigging, and game development.

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2023 i started my study in front-end development. 
                    Programming is something that i have always wanted to learn, but it seemed a bit scary.
                    my father has always been a programmer and tryed to influence me to 
                    start programming. And i have always had the urge to start. And finaly i have!
                    Building this website is one of the first projects i have had outside of school.
